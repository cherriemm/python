# Tutorial



## Introduction

Z3 is an efficient SMT(Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver with specialized algorithms for solving background theories. 

One can interact with Z3 over SMT-LIB2 scripts supplied as a text file or pipe to Z3, or using API calls from a high-level programming language that are proxies for calls over a C-based API.

- A formula P is valid if P always evaluates to true for any assignment of appropriate values to its
  function symbols.

-  A formula P is satisfiable if there is some assignment of appropriate values to its function symbols under which P evaluates to true. 

  Validity is about finding a proof of a statement; satisfiability is about finding a solution to a set of constraints.

- Consider a logical expression P with some free constants, say x and y. We can ask whether P is

  valid, that is whether it is always true for any combination of values for x and y. If P is always

  true, then :P is always false, and then :P will not have any satisfying assignment; that is, :P is

  unsatisfiable. In other words,

  P is valid precisely when :P is not satisfiable (is unsatisfiable).

  Alternately,

  P is satisfiable if and only if :P is not valid (is invalid).

  SMT solvers find satisfying assignments (or report that there are none). To determine whether a

  formula P is valid, we ask an SMT solver whether :P is satisfiable. Similarly, to determine if

  (P^Q))R

  is valid, we ask whether its negation,

  P^Q^:R,

  is satisfiable. If the latter is unsatisfiable, the former is valid.









## Theories



### Arithmetic

- Z3 has built-in support for integer and real constants. These two types should not be confused with machine integers (32-bit or 64-bit) and floating point numbers. 

  These two types (sorts) represent the mathematical integers and reals.

use `declare-const`  to declare integer and real constants.

```
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-const b Real)
```



- After constants are declared, assert formulas containing constants and arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, 

  ```
  (declare-const a Int)
  (declare-const b Int)
  (declare-const c Int)
  (declare-const d Real)
  (declare-const e Real)
  (assert (< a (+ b 2)))
  (assert (= a (+ (* 2 c) 10)))
  (assert (= (+ c b) 1000))
  (assert (= d e))
  (check-sat)
  (get-model)
  ```

  -  `check-sat`  :  instructs Z3  to find an interpretation for the declared constants that makes all formulas true

    **The interpretation is basically assigning a number to each constant.** If such interpretation exists, we say it is a model for the asserted formulas. 

  - The command `get-model` displays the model built by Z3.



- Real constants should contain a decimal point. 

  Unlike most programming languages, Z3 will not convert automatically integers into reals and vice-versa. The function `to-real` can be used to convert an integer expression into a real one.

  ```
  (declare-const a Int)
  (declare-const b Int)
  (declare-const c Int)
  (declare-const d Real)
  (declare-const e Real)
  (assert (< e (+ (to_real (+ a b)) 2.0)))
  (assert (= d (+ (to_real c) 0.5)))
  (assert (< a b))
  (check-sat)
  (get-model)
  ```

  

  

### Arrays

- `(select a i)` returns the value stored at position i of the array a 
- `(store a i v)` returns a new array identical to a, but on position i it contains the value v 



#### Select and Store

```
(declare-const x Int)
(declare-const y Int)
(declare-const a1 (Array Int INt))
(declare-const a2 (Array Int Int))
(assert (= (select a1 x) x))
(assert (= (store a1 x y) a1))
```

the constraint (and (= (select a1 x) x) (= (store a1 x y) a1)) is satisfiable for an array that contains an index x that maps to x, and when x = y (because the first equality forced the range of x to be x)



























## Basic commands

A Z3 script is a sequence of commands

Internally, Z3 maintains a stack of user provided formulas and declarations . We say these are the assertions provided by the user



The command `echo` displays a message.



### declare

In the following example, we declare a function `f` that receives an integer and a Boolean and returns an integer.

```
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
```

- The command `declare-const` declares a constant of a given type (aka sort)

- The command `declare-fun` declares a function.



### assert

The assert command adds a formula to the Z3 internal stack .

We say that the set of formulas in the Z3 stack is   *satisfiable* if there is an interpretation( for the user declared constants and functions) that makes all asserted formulas true .

```
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
(assert(< a 10))
(assert(< f a true) 100)
(check-sat)
```

- The first asserted formula states that the constant `a` must be less than 10.

- The second one states that the function `f` applied to `a` and `true` must return a value less than 100.

- The `check-sat` command determines whether the current formulas on the Z3 stack are satisfiable or not.
  - If the formulas are satisfiable, Z3 returns `sat` . 
  - If they are not satisfiable, Z3 returns `unsat` , 
  - Z3 may also return `unknown` if it can't determine whether a formula is satisfiable or not.

- When the `check-sat` command returns `sat` , the `get-model` command can be used to retrieve that makes all formulas on the Z3 internal stack true.



### Interpretation

The interpretation is provided using definitions. 

example :

```
(define-fun a() Int [val])
```

states that the value of a in the model is [val] . 



`(define-fun f ((x!1 Int) (x!2 Bool)) Int ... )` is very similar to a function definition used in programming languages. 

In this example, x!1 and x!2 are the arguments of the function interpretation created by Z3.

the definition of f is based on ite's (aka if-then-elses or conditional expressions).



> (ite (and (= x!1 11) (= x!2 false)) 21 0)

evaluates to (returns) 21 when x!1 is equal to 11, and x!2 is equal to false. Otherwise, it returns 0.



### Using Scopes

- In some applications, we want to explore several similar problems that share several definitions and assertions. 

  We can use the commands `push` and `pop` for doing that. 

- Z3 maintains a global stack of declarations and assertions. 

  - The `push` command creates a new scope by saving the current stack size. 
  - The `pop` command removes any assertion or declaration performed between it and the matching `push`. 

  The `check-sat` and `get-assertions` commands always operate on the content of the global stack.

```
(declare-const x Int)
(declare-const y Int)
(declare-const z Int)
(push)
(assert ( = (+ x y) 10))
(assert (= (+ x (* 2 y)) 20))
(check-sat)
(pop) ; remove the two assertions
(push) 
(assert (= (+ (* 3 x) y) 10))
(assert (= (+ (* 2 x) (* 2 y)) 21))
(check-sat)
(declare-const p Bool)
(pop)
(assert p) ; error, since declaration of p was removed from the stack
```





### Additional commands









## Logical Interfaces to Z3

Z3 takes as input simple-sorted formulas that may contain symbols with pre-defined meanings defined by a *theory*. 



- **As a basis, propositional formulas are built from atomic variables and logical connectives**

  example:

  ```python
  from z3 import *
  Tie, Shirt = Bools('Tie Shirt')
  s = Solver()
  s.add(Or(Tie, SHirt)).
  	  Or(Not(Tie), Shirt),
        Or(Not(Tie), Not(Shirt))
  print(s.check())
  print(s.model())
  ```

  This example introduces two Boolean variables Tie and Shirt.

  It then creates a Solver object and adds three assertions.

  ![image-20240409201135478](C:\Users\89388\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240409201135478.png)

  - The call to `s.check()` produces a verdict `sat`;

    there is a satisfying assignment for the formulas. A satisfying model, where `Tie` is false and `Shirt` is true, can be extracted using `s.model()`.

     For convenience the Python front-end to Z3 contains some shorthand functions. The function `solve` sets up a solver, adds assertions, checks satisfiability, and prints a model if one is available.

Propositional logic is an important, but smaller subset of formulas handled by Z3. It can reason about formulas that combine symbols from several theories, such as the theories for arrays and arithmetic:

```python
Z = IntSort()
f = Function('f', Z, Z)
x, y, z = Ints('x y z')
A = Array('A', Z, Z)
fml = Implies(x + 2 == y, f(Store(A, x, 3)[y - 2]) == f(y - x + 1))
solve(Not(fml))
```
