# Tutorial



## Introduction

Z3 is an efficient SMT(Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver with specialized algorithms for solving background theories. 

One can interact with Z3 over SMT-LIB2 scripts supplied as a text file or pipe to Z3, or using API calls from a high-level programming language that are proxies for calls over a C-based API.

- A formula P is valid if P always evaluates to true for any assignment of appropriate values to its
  function symbols.

-  A formula P is satisfiable if there is some assignment of appropriate values to its function symbols under which P evaluates to true. 

  Validity is about finding a proof of a statement; satisfiability is about finding a solution to a set of constraints.

- Consider a logical expression P with some free constants, say x and y. We can ask whether P is

  valid, that is whether it is always true for any combination of values for x and y. If P is always

  true, then :P is always false, and then :P will not have any satisfying assignment; that is, :P is

  unsatisfiable. In other words,

  P is valid precisely when :P is not satisfiable (is unsatisfiable).

  Alternately,

  P is satisfiable if and only if :P is not valid (is invalid).

  SMT solvers find satisfying assignments (or report that there are none). To determine whether a

  formula P is valid, we ask an SMT solver whether :P is satisfiable. Similarly, to determine if

  (P^Q))R

  is valid, we ask whether its negation,

  P^Q^:R,

  is satisfiable. If the latter is unsatisfiable, the former is valid.









## Theories



### `ast`

Abstract syntax tree (AST)

```
Array	Ast node representing an array value. An array in Z3 is a mapping from indices to values.
BV	Ast node representing a bitvector value.
Bool	Ast node representing a boolean value.
Datatype	Ast node representing a datatype or enumeration value.
Dynamic	A dynamically typed Ast node.
Float	Ast node representing a float value.
Int	Ast node representing an integer value.
Real	Ast node representing a real value.
Regexp	Ast node representing a regular expression.
Set	Ast node representing a set value.
String	Ast node representing a string value.
```

1. **Constructing ASTs**: You can construct ASTs using the Z3 API provided by the Z3 library. This involves creating variables, constants, and applying various operations (e.g., addition, multiplication, logical operations) to construct complex expressions.
2. **Manipulating ASTs**: Once ASTs are constructed, you can manipulate them by applying transformations, substitutions, and other operations to simplify or transform the formulas.
3. **Passing ASTs to Z3 solver**: Finally, you pass the ASTs representing your logical formulas to the Z3 solver for analysis. The solver then uses various algorithms and techniques to reason about the formulas and provide solutions, such as determining satisfiability, finding models, or proving unsatisfiability.



The method `sort` retrieves the sort of an expression.

```python
x = Int('x')
y = Real('y')

print((x+1).sort())
print((y+1).sort())
print((x + 2 > y).sort())
```

​	









### Arithmetic

- Z3 has built-in support for integer and real constants. These two types should not be confused with machine integers (32-bit or 64-bit) and floating point numbers. 

  These two types (sorts) represent the mathematical integers and reals.

use `declare-const`  to declare integer and real constants.

```
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-const b Real)
```



- After constants are declared, assert formulas containing constants and arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, 

  ```
  (declare-const a Int)
  (declare-const b Int)
  (declare-const c Int)
  (declare-const d Real)
  (declare-const e Real)
  (assert (< a (+ b 2)))
  (assert (= a (+ (* 2 c) 10)))
  (assert (= (+ c b) 1000))
  (assert (= d e))
  (check-sat)
  (get-model)
  ```

  -  `check-sat`  :  instructs Z3  to find an interpretation for the declared constants that makes all formulas true

    **The interpretation is basically assigning a number to each constant.** If such interpretation exists, we say it is a model for the asserted formulas. 

  - The command `get-model` displays the model built by Z3.



- Real constants should contain a decimal point. 

  Unlike most programming languages, Z3 will not convert automatically integers into reals and vice-versa. The function `to-real` can be used to convert an integer expression into a real one.

  ```
  (declare-const a Int)
  (declare-const b Int)
  (declare-const c Int)
  (declare-const d Real)
  (declare-const e Real)
  (assert (< e (+ (to_real (+ a b)) 2.0)))
  (assert (= d (+ (to_real c) 0.5)))
  (assert (< a b))
  (check-sat)
  (get-model)
  ```

  

  

### Arrays

- `(select a i)` returns the value stored at position i of the array a 
- `(store a i v)` returns a new array identical to a, but on position i it contains the value v 



#### Select and Store

```
(declare-const x Int)
(declare-const y Int)
(declare-const a1 (Array Int INt))
(declare-const a2 (Array Int Int))
(assert (= (select a1 x) x))
(assert (= (store a1 x y) a1))
```

the constraint (and (= (select a1 x) x) (= (store a1 x y) a1)) is satisfiable for an array that contains an index x that maps to x, and when x = y (because the first equality forced the range of x to be x)



























## Basic commands

A Z3 script is a sequence of commands

Internally, Z3 maintains a stack of user provided formulas and declarations . We say these are the assertions provided by the user



The command `echo` displays a message.



### declare

In the following example, we declare a function `f` that receives an integer and a Boolean and returns an integer.

```
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
```

- The command `declare-const` declares a constant of a given type (aka sort)

- The command `declare-fun` declares a function.



### assert

The assert command adds a formula to the Z3 internal stack .

We say that the set of formulas in the Z3 stack is   *satisfiable* if there is an interpretation( for the user declared constants and functions) that makes all asserted formulas true .

```
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
(assert(< a 10))
(assert(< f a true) 100)
(check-sat)
```

- The first asserted formula states that the constant `a` must be less than 10.

- The second one states that the function `f` applied to `a` and `true` must return a value less than 100.

- The `check-sat` command determines whether the current formulas on the Z3 stack are satisfiable or not.
  - If the formulas are satisfiable, Z3 returns `sat` . 
  - If they are not satisfiable, Z3 returns `unsat` , 
  - Z3 may also return `unknown` if it can't determine whether a formula is satisfiable or not.

- When the `check-sat` command returns `sat` , the `get-model` command can be used to retrieve that makes all formulas on the Z3 internal stack true.



### Interpretation

The interpretation is provided using definitions. 

example :

```
(define-fun a() Int [val])
```

states that the value of a in the model is [val] . 



`(define-fun f ((x!1 Int) (x!2 Bool)) Int ... )` is very similar to a function definition used in programming languages. 

In this example, x!1 and x!2 are the arguments of the function interpretation created by Z3.

the definition of f is based on ite's (aka if-then-elses or conditional expressions).



> (ite (and (= x!1 11) (= x!2 false)) 21 0)

evaluates to (returns) 21 when x!1 is equal to 11, and x!2 is equal to false. Otherwise, it returns 0.



### Using Scopes

- In some applications, we want to explore several similar problems that share several definitions and assertions. 

  We can use the commands `push` and `pop` for doing that. 

- Z3 maintains a global stack of declarations and assertions. 

  - The `push` command creates a new scope by saving the current stack size. 
  - The `pop` command removes any assertion or declaration performed between it and the matching `push`. 

  The `check-sat` and `get-assertions` commands always operate on the content of the global stack.

```
(declare-const x Int)
(declare-const y Int)
(declare-const z Int)
(push)
(assert ( = (+ x y) 10))
(assert (= (+ x (* 2 y)) 20))
(check-sat)
(pop) ; remove the two assertions
(push) 
(assert (= (+ (* 3 x) y) 10))
(assert (= (+ (* 2 x) (* 2 y)) 21))
(check-sat)
(declare-const p Bool)
(pop)
(assert p) ; error, since declaration of p was removed from the stack
```





### Additional commands















# z3 API in python



## Getting started





```python
x = Int('x')
y = Int('y')
solve(x > 2, y < 10, x + 2*y == 7)
```

The function `Int('x')` creates an integer variable in Z3 named `x`. 

The `solve` function solves a system of constraints



- **Traversing expressions**

```python
x, y = Int('x', 'y')
n = x + y > 3
print ("num args: ", n.num_args())  # num args:  2
print ("children: ", n.children()) # children:  [x + y, 3]
print ("1st child:", n.arg(0)) # 1st child: x + y
print ("2nd child:", n.arg(1)) # 3
print ("operator: ", n.decl()) # >=
print ("op name:  ", n.decl().name()) # >=
```



- `set_option`

  procedure `set_option` is used to configure the Z3 environment. It is used to set global configuration options such as how the result is displayed.

  ```python
  x = Real('x')
  y = Real('y')
  solve(x**2 + y**2 == 3, x**3 == 2)
  
  set_option(precision=30)
  print ("Solving, and displaying result with 30 decimal places")
  solve(x**2 + y**2 == 3, x**3 == 2)
  ```

  The option `set_option(precision=30)` sets the number of decimal places used when displaying results. The `?` mark in `1.2599210498?` indicates the output is truncated



- rational , irrational number in z3py

  ```python
  print (1/3)
  print (RealVal(1)/3)
  print (Q(1,3))
  
  x = Real('x')
  print (x + 1/3)
  print (x + Q(1,3))
  print (x + "1/3")
  print (x + 0.25)
  
  """
  0.3333333333333333
  1/3
  1/3
  x + 3333333333333333/10000000000000000
  x + 1/3
  x + 1/3
  x + 1/4
  """
  ```

   The expression `3/2` is a Python integer and not a Z3 rational number. 

  different ways to create rational numbers in Z3Py :

   `Q(num, den)`  : creates a Z3 rational, `num` is the numerator and `den` is the denominator. 

  `RealVal(1)` creates a Z3 real number representing the number `1`.

  

  

  **Rational numbers can also be displayed in decimal notation.**

  ```python
  x = Real('x')
  solve(3*x == 1)
  
  set_option(rational_to_decimal=True)
  solve(3*x == 1)
  
  set_option(precision=30)
  solve(3*x == 1)
  ```

  



## Boolean Logic

Z3 takes as input simple-sorted formulas that may contain symbols with pre-defined meanings defined by a *theory*. 



- **As a basis, propositional formulas are built from atomic variables and logical connectives**

  example:

  ```python
  from z3 import *
  Tie, Shirt = Bools('Tie Shirt')
  s = Solver()
  s.add(Or(Tie, Shirt),
  	  Or(Not(Tie), Shirt),
        Or(Not(Tie), Not(Shirt)))
  print(s.check())
  print(s.model())
  
  """
  sat
  [Tie = False, Shirt = True]
  """
  ```

  create a Solver object and adds three assertions.

  ![image-20240409201135478](C:\Users\89388\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240409201135478.png)

  -  `s.check()` produces a verdict `sat`;

     A satisfying model, where `Tie` is false and `Shirt` is true, can be extracted using `s.model()`.




Z3 supports Boolean operators: `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `Implies` (implication), `If` (if-then-else). Bi-implications are represented using equality `==`. The following example shows how to solve a simple set of Boolean constraints.

```python
p = Bool('p')
q = Bool('q')
r = Bool('r')
solve(Implies(p, q), r == Not(q), Or(Not(p), r))
```



- uses a combination of polynomial and Boolean constraints.

  ```python
  p = Bool('p')
  x = Real('x')
  solve(Or(x < 5, x > 10), Or(p, x**2 == 2), Not(p))
  ```

  

### Implication

An implication statement can be represented in the form "if....then". The symbol ⇒ is used to show the implication. 

Suppose there are two statements, P and Q.

In this case, the statement "if P then Q" can also be written as P ⇒ Q or P → Q, and it will be read as "P implies Q". In this implication, the statement P is a hypothesis, which is also known as premise and antecedent, and the statement Q is conclusion, which is also known as the consequent.

If the implication of the statements is known to be true, then whenever the premise is met, the conclusion must also be true. Because of this reason, the implication is also known as the conditional statement.

1. If p then q
2. If p, q
3. q when p
4. Q only if P
5. q unless ~p
6. q whenever p
7. p is a sufficient condition for q
8. q follow p
9. p implies q
10. A necessary condition for p is q
11. q if p
12. q is necessary for p
13. p is a necessary condition for q

| P    | Q    | P ⇒ q |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| T    | T    | T     |
| T    | F    | F     |
| F    | T    | T     |
| F    | F    | T     |









```python
Z = IntSort()
f = Function('f', Z, Z)
x, y, z = Ints('x y z')
A = Array('A', Z, Z)
fml = Implies(x + 2 == y, f(Store(A, x, 3)[y - 2]) == f(y - x + 1))
solve(Not(fml))
```







## Solver

Z3 provides different solvers. The command `solve`, is implemented using the Z3 solver API.

```python
x = Int('x')
y = Int('y')

s = Solver()
print (s) # []

s.add(x > 10, y == x + 2)
print (s) # [x > 10, y == x + 2]
print (s.check()) # sat

s.push()
s.add(y < 11)
print (s)  # [x > 10, y == x + 2, y < 11]

print (s.check()) # unsat

s.pop()
print (s) # [x > 10, y == x + 2]

print (s.check()) # sat
```

- The command `Solver()` creates a general purpose solver. Constraints can be added using the method `add`.  We say the constraints have been **asserted** in the solver.

- The method `check()` solves the asserted constraints. The result is `sat` (satisfiable) if a solution was found. The result is `unsat` (unsatisfiable) if no solution exists ,We may also say the system of asserted constraints is **infeasible**

- a solver may fail to solve a system of constraints and `unknown` is returned.

  The following example shows an example that Z3 cannot solve. The solver returns `unknown` in this case. Recall that Z3 can solve nonlinear polynomial constraints, but `2**x` is not a polynomial.

  ```
  x = Real('x')
  s = Solver()
  s.add(2**x == 3)
  print (s.check())
  ```

- In some applications, we want to explore several similar problems that share several constraints. We can use the commands `push` and `pop` for doing that. Each solver maintains a stack of assertions. The command `push` creates a new scope by saving the current stack size. The command `pop` removes any assertion performed between it and the matching `push`. The `check` method always operates on the content of solver assertion stack.
